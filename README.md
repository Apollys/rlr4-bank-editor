# Bank Editor for Starcraft II's Runling Run 4

Last tested in early 2018

This is a GUI app build using the QT framework on C++.  It allows you to select any possible stats that this game (Runling Run 4) allows, and then saves a bank file containing this data encrypted and encoded exactly as the game itself would do so.  Thus, the resulting bank file is indistinguishable to Battle.net and RLR4's script from a real bank file generated by the game itself.

I am uploading this to show an example of a somewhat recent C++ hobby project I have undertaken.
